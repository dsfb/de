  Communication between the display server and the display device driver.

  This communication can be done using 'packets'. Or sending messages 
via syscall or another method. The driver can export a handle just like a 
file descriptor or a pathname.

  We gotta send packets to the device driver 
of the current 'display device' device driver.
  Remember, this server has full access to the video ram (LFB),
so it means that the device driver is embedded into the server. But, 
at the same time, the server can use syscalls and tell to the kernel 
to draw into the video ram (LFB), in this case it means that the 
device driver of the display device is embedded into the base kernel. 
  Inside the base kernel we can have more than one driver for the display device.
For now we have one that is called 'boot display device', its because it has the 
properties given to the kernel during the boot process. And a second one will be created 
called 'qemu display device', it means that we're will be able to change the resolution 
using this driver.
  The goal is expose these device drivers usint a handle, just like a file path or file descriptor,
just like any other device.
  In the future we can have more 'display device drivers' and all them need to be exported 
to this server, this way the server can send requests to these drivers to put data into 
the video ram (LFB) or change resolution.
